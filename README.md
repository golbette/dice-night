# dice-night
Dice roller made using nodeJS and express.

It has a cozy dark scheme that I like.

Very limited right now! It rolls a number six-sided 'dice' and kicks back the result.

If you want to play with it, feel free to clone it.

A hosted version of this thing is forthcoming (i.e., when I feel like there's enough of it to warrant spending money hosting it.)
